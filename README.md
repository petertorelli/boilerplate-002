For those of you who don't want to be bothered with webpack/fusebox/parcel/vue-cli/next/nuxt, etc. This A simple NodeJS starting point for a "collection of stuff" with basic authentication. Sort of a throwback to PHP days, where you can just drop a new route in there without having to recompile the entire project.

Uses:

* ExpressJS
* Pug
* Bcrypt
* JWT
* ESLint
* Typescript
* Nodemon
* Bootstrap 5
